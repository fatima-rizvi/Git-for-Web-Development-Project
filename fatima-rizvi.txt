Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?
        Block elements always start on a new line and take up the full width that alloted to them, whereas inline elements do not start on a new line and they only take up the necessary space. An example of a block element is <p>. An example of an inline element is <img>.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
        Its position is then fixed and it sits on its own layer, unaffected by the flow of the rest of the document.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
        You can set the height to the maximum size you are willing to allow the element to take up and then set the elements width to auto.
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
        Display block: <div>, <h1>, <header>
        Display inline: <span>, <a>
        Display inline-block: <button>
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
